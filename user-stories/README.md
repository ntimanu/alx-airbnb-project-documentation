# User Stories Directory

## Overview

This directory contains the user stories documentation for the Airbnb Clone application project. User stories are derived from the use case diagram and represent the functional requirements from the user's perspective.

## Contents

### Files in this directory:

- `user-stories.md` - Complete collection of user stories for the Airbnb Clone application
- `README.md` - This file, providing overview and guidance

## User Story Format

All user stories follow the standard format:

```
As a [user type]
I want to [goal/action]
So that [reason/benefit]
```

Each user story includes:

- **User Type**: Who is performing the action (guest, host, admin)
- **Goal**: What the user wants to accomplish
- **Benefit**: Why the user needs this functionality
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete

## Story Categories

The user stories are organized into the following categories:

1. **User Authentication & Management** (US-001 to US-003)
2. **Property Search & Discovery** (US-004 to US-006)
3. **Booking Management** (US-007 to US-009)
4. **Reviews & Ratings** (US-010 to US-011)
5. **Host Property Management** (US-012 to US-013)
6. **Communication & Notifications** (US-014 to US-015)
7. **Payment Processing** (US-016 to US-017)
8. **Admin Dashboard** (US-018 to US-019)

## Priority Levels

Stories are classified into three priority levels:

- **High Priority (MVP)**: Core functionality required for minimum viable product
- **Medium Priority**: Important features for full user experience
- **Low Priority**: Nice-to-have features for future releases

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers:

1. Review acceptance criteria before starting implementation
2. Create unit tests based on acceptance criteria
3. Update story status as development progresses
4. Note any dependencies between stories

### For Product Managers:

1. Use stories for sprint planning and backlog management
2. Prioritize stories based on business value
3. Validate acceptance criteria with stakeholders
4. Track story completion and delivery

### For QA/Testing:

1. Create test cases based on acceptance criteria
2. Validate user flows across related stories
3. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met before marking complete
4. Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Traceability

Each user story can be traced back to:

- Original use case diagram
- Feature requirements document
- Technical architecture decisions
- Business requirements

## Revision History

- **Version 1.0**: Initial user stories creation from use case diagram
- Future versions will be documented as requirements evolve

## Next Steps

1. Review and validate user stories with stakeholders
2. Estimate effort for each story
3. Create sprint backlog based on priority
4. Begin implementation of high-priority stories
5. Regularly review and update stories based on feedback
